WatDo is a web application that helps you visualize and plan tasks using a graph-based approach. It allows you to create nodes representing tasks or ideas and connect them in both forward and backward directions to build comprehensive planning workflows.

## Features

- **Forward and Backward Planning**: Create connections in both directions to build comprehensive planning structures
- **Time-based Visualization**: Nodes are positioned on a timeline, allowing you to organize tasks by age/time
- **Interactive Graph Editor**: Easily add, connect, and modify nodes in a flexible flow-based interface
- **Dynamic Generation**: Generate new planning branches based on your inputs
